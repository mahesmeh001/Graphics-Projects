# Graphics Projects
These are projects I worked on to pursue the Graphics sect of CS. I worked methodologically, with each project increasing in complexity and tackling a new dimension (both metaphorically, and in project 4 onwards literally) of graphics. 

Project 1 covered animation and creating a 2D space. 

Project 2 introduced hierarchical modeling. 

Project 3 combined animation and hierarchical modeling using explicit matrix and vector representations for the points and transforms involved.

Project 4 used a parametric curve to define an intricate trajectory, and used that representation both to draw such a curve as well as move/animate an object along it.

Finally, project 5 culminated everything by hierarchically modeling an animation using parametric curves viewed using a moveable camera. The camera uses 2D drawing operations to construct a 2D projected view onto your screen.
